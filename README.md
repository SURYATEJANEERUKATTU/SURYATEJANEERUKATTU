## FAQ

#### Is this CropShare related Window?

No...!!, CropShare is still at nascent stage and not yet open-sourced and *this is just a small window related to ssl certificates stuff and made for testing GUI,smpt,touchbackresponse,e.t.c which might be useful for CropShare Application project.

#### How to get Script validator credentials?

It is not implemented completly.. still under testing but anyway Its not related to this ssl window.
